## Announcements 
* Questions?

## End-of-semester stuff:
* Github has limitations as an LMS, so your help is appreciated making sure you've gotten proper credit
* Check that your post or issue is tagged to each milestone *if you completed it on time*.  
* Get the links to your three (or two, if you went to a big workshop) Meetups
* Make sure you're on my Extra Credit list if you did extra credit

## Project updates 
(Timekeepers: 7 minutes and 10 minutes)

* What's your milestone list now?
* What's your progress?
* What's your plan to finish?

## Presentation Order

To determine this order, I'll run the following code:

```python
from random import shuffle

list = range(1,16)          # There are 15 groups
shuffle(list)

print list
```

Here are the group numbers: 

1. Yu
2. Dave, Elizabeth, and Amber
3. Kyle 
4. Alex
5. Jaleesa
6. Caroline
7. Mary
8. Ashley, Landon, and Danielle
9. Olivia, Leslie, and James
10. Stacey and Michelle
11. Jonathon and Grant
12. Sarah
13. Chris
14. Josh
15. Erin
