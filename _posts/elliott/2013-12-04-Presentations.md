## Wrap-up first
Thanks for a great semester!  This is the first semester this course has been required and it will continue to evolve.  I've got quite a few changes and improvements in mind, including a stronger focus on Python and web frameworks like Flask and Django and more hands on with Pygame earlier in the semester so students are better equipped for the final project.  The course will meet once a week, giving us more time together, and I'm working on a volunteer TA.  Your feedback, through our [feedback form], the SILS course evaluation, and the University's course evaluation will be instrumental in helping me revise the course for next semester and beyond.

## Final Projects

Send me a link to your project Github repo.  Let me know if you plan on committing to it after midnight Weds- I'll grade what you have as of your last commit before midnight.  As a reminder, here are the final project criteria:

**Project Grading Criteria** 

* Vision and purpose: 10 points. Is the project's purpose well-stated and reasonable? Is the project's vision exciting to those interested in what it does?
* Collaboration: 15 points. Did the project team utilize open and closed collaboration tools effectively?
* Technology: 15 points. Did the team select and utilize appropriate open source technologies for the project?
* Re-usability: 25 points. Is the project easily re-usable? This might include thorough documentation, example(s), customizibility via config files, modularity, and other features that make it easy for others to use the project for their purposes.
* Contributor-Friendliness: 25 points. Is there a contributor guidelines file? A licence? Is the code well-documented and/or commented so a sufficiently motivated and experienced coder could contribute?
* Uniqueness: 10 points. Is the project unique in approach or functionality? Where it's similar to other projects, are the differences made clear?
