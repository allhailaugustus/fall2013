## Announcements 

* Questions?


## Standup 

* What have you done since last time?
* What will you commit to for next time?
* Any roadblocks you need help on?


## Project Updates (aka presentations) 

Next week we'll have two days of ~7 minute project updates from each of our 15 groups.  This will be a time to show off what you've done, milestones you've hit, and describe how you're going to bring the project home.  It'll also be a way for me to give feedback and advice before the projects are actually due.  I'll give feedback to each group and follow up over email if I think there are any changes that need to be made.


We're almost there!
